He received his first official production credits at age nineteen, when he produced eight tracks on Down to Earth, the 1996 debut album of Chicago-based underground rapper Grav.[30] In 1998, West was the first producer signed to the management-production company Hip Hop Since 1978, founded by Gee Roberson and Kyambo ""Hip-Hop"" Joshua.[31] For a time, West acted as a ghost producer for Deric ""D-Dot"" Angelettie. Due to his association with Angelettie, West was not able to release a solo album, so he formed the Go-Getters, a hip hop group composed of him and fellow Chicago natives GLC, Timmy G, Really Doe, and Arrowstar.[32][33] The Go-Getters independently released their first and only studio album, World Record Holders in 1999 through West's company, Konman Productions.[32] West spent much of the late 1990s further producing for several musical acts.[34] He produced the third track on Foxy Brown's second studio album Chyna Doll (1999), which became the second hip-hop album by a female rapper to peak atop the US Billboard 200 chart.[34]",kanye.txt,True

It was leaked months before its release date,[38] and West used the opportunity to remix, remaster, and revise the album before its release;[44] West added new verses, string arrangements, gospel choirs, and improved drum programming.[38] The album was postponed three times from its initial date in August 2003,[45][46] and was eventually released in February 2004, reaching No. 2 on the Billboard 200 as his debut single, ""Through the Wire"" peaked at No. 15 while on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five weeks.[47] ""Slow Jamz"", his second single, featuring Twista and Jamie Foxx, became the three musicians' first No. 1 hit.

"West invested $2 million and took over a year to make his second album.[55] West was inspired by Roseland NYC Live, a 1998 live album by English trip hop group Portishead, produced with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra,[56] incorporating string arrangements into his hip-hop production. Though West had not been able to afford many live instruments around the time of his debut album, the money from his commercial success enabled him to hire a string orchestra for his second album Late Registration.[56] West collaborated with American film score composer Jon Brion, who served as the album's co-executive producer for several tracks.[57][58] Late Registration sold over 2.3 million units in the United States alone by the end of 2005 and was considered by industry observers as the only successful major album release of the fall season, which had been plagued by steadily declining CD sales.[59]",kanye.txt,True

This promotion ran from August to December 2010.[99] Dark Fantasy went on to go platinum in the United States,[100] but its omission as a contender for Album of the Year at the 54th Grammy Awards was viewed as a ""snub"" by several media outlets.[101]",kanye.txt,True

"Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as Eminem (stylized as EMINƎM), is an American rapper, music producer and songwriter.

While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him a controversial figure, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has been cited as influencing many musical artists. His most successful songs on the US Billboard Hot 100 include ""The Real Slim Shady"", ""Without Me"", ""Lose Yourself"", ""Not Afraid"", ""Love the Way You Lie"", ""The Monster"", ""Godzilla"" and ""Houdini"".",eminem.txt,True

During this period, Eminem's rhyming style, primarily inspired by rappers Nas, Esham and AZ, lacked the comically violent slant for which he later became known.[32] Detroit disc jockeys largely ignored Infinite and the feedback Eminem did receive (""Why don't you go into rock and roll?"") led him to craft angrier, moodier tracks.[13]",eminem.txt,True

"Eminem is considered unusual in structuring his songs around the lyrics, rather than writing to beats.[46] One exception was ""Stan"", which came from an idea and scratch track produced by the 45 King.[46] After doing little production on Relapse and Recovery, Eminem produced a significant portion of The Marshall Mathers LP 2. He said about producing his own music, ""Sometimes, I may get something in my head, like an idea or the mood of something that I would want, and I'm not always gonna get that by going through different tracks that other people have made. They don't know what's in my head. I think maybe it helps, a little bit, with diversity, the sound of it, but also, I would get something in my head and want to be able to lay down that idea from scratch.""[284] In 1998 when his beef with rapper Cage was still happening, New York rapper Necro (who had previously produced three songs for Cage) met Eminem and gave him a CD with the beat to what eventually became the beat for the song ""Black Helicopters"" by rap group Non-Phixion.

US critics point to [Eminem's] vivid portraits of disenfranchised lives—using the stark, direct language of the street—as an accurate reflection of social injustice."" In addition, the BBC highlighted that, ""Where parents once recoiled in horror [to his music], there now seems a greater willingness to acknowledge a music that is striking such a chord among the American young, angry white underclass.""[296] Dan Ozzi of Vice highlighted that Eminem during the early 2000s was ""the one artist high school kids seemed to unanimously connect with.... he represented everything high school years are about: blind rage, misguided rebellion, adolescent frustration.

Eminem was that good. I just thought, 'Fuck, this man is amazing'. There are very few performers who can grab you like that the first time—only the greats.""[299] John further praised Eminem, saying, ""Eminem is a true poet of his time, someone we'll be talking about for decades to come.

Rooted in East Coast hip hop and particularly gangsta rap, he is widely considered to be one of the greatest rappers of all time.

"Shakur's music and philosophical outlook were deeply influenced by a wide range of American, African American, and global influences, including the Black Panther Party, black nationalism, egalitarianism, and the concept of liberty. Moreover, Shakur's artistic sensibilities were enriched by his passion for theater and admiration for the works of William Shakespeare. Notably, he honed his theatrical skills as a student at the Baltimore School for the Arts, where he delved into the psychological complexities inherent in inter-gang warfare and inter-cultural conflicts, reflecting themes explored in Shakespearean dramas.[1]",tupac.txt,True
"2Pacalypse Now (1991), showcased his socially conscious perspective. Through powerful tracks like ""Brenda's Got a Baby"", ""Trapped"", and ""Part Time Mutha"", Shakur addressed social injustice, poverty, and police brutality. In doing so, he contributed to the ongoing success of rap groups such as Boogie Down Productions, Public Enemy, X-Clan, and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, while establishing himself as one of the pioneering socially conscious rappers from the West Coast.[10]",tupac.txt,True
"Continuing his focus on the social challenges faced by African American people, Shakur's second album featured songs like ""The Streetz R Deathrow"" and ""Last Wordz"". Simultaneously, he showcased his compassionate side with the empowering anthem ""Keep Ya Head Up"", and his legendary intensity with the title track from the album Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z... Additionally, he paid homage to his former group Digital Underground by including them on the playful track ""I Get Around"". Throughout his career, Shakur's subsequent albums reflected a growing assertiveness in his approach.[14]",tupac.txt,True
"Shakur's body of work encompassed contrasting themes, including social inequality, injustice, compassion, playfulness, and hope. These elements continued to shape his artistry, exemplified by his explosive 1995 album Me Against the World.[18] The release of All Eyez on Me in 1996 further solidified his reputation, with tracks like ""Ambitionz az a Ridah"", ""I Ain't Mad at Cha"", ""California Love"", ""Life Goes On"", and ""Picture Me Rollin'"" being hailed as classics by critics. Shakur described All Eyez on Me as a celebration of life, and the album achieved both critical acclaim and commercial success.[15] According to Eminem, Tupac is the greatest songwriter of all time.[242] Nas said in 2002:""I put Tupac beyond Shakespeare.""[243]",tupac.txt,True
Vocal style,tupac.txt,True
"Singers can manipulate different parts of their body to create various sounds. For instance, the ""head voice"" involves singing high-pitched tones resonating from the head, while the ""chest voice"" utilizes the chest area. In the documentary ""Tupac Shakur: Thug Angel,"" Greg ""Shock G"" Jacobs, one of Shakur's early producers, discusses how rappers also utilize different bodily areas to project their voices. According to him, ""Slick Rick rhymed from the nasal palate, Nas from the back of his throat, and Pac from the pit of his stomach, which is where his power came from."" Shakur's influences stemmed from powerful orators like Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. Despite not being physically imposing, Shakur's voice carried immense weight and power, reminiscent of these influential speakers.",tupac.txt,True
"Shakur was also known for his technique of stacking or layering vocals, adding depth and rawness to his voice. This approach, demonstrated notably on tracks like ""Dear Mama"" from his 1995 album Me Against the World, involves overlaying multiple vocal lines to highlight rhythms and emphasize words and phrases. Mastering this technique requires precision to maintain flow and clarity, as heard in the lyrics ""and even though I act crazy/I gotta thank the Lord that you made me,"" where Shakur's voice transitions from full to husky, underscoring the emotional depth of the lyrics. Despite its difficulty, Shakur's background in jazz, poetry, and theater endowed him with exceptional rhythm control, enabling him to layer vocals seamlessly while preserving cohesion and flow.[244]",tupac.txt,True

There are murals bearing his likeness in New York, Brazil, Sierra Leone, Bulgaria and countless other places; he even has statues in Atlanta and Germany. Quite simply, no other rapper has captured the world's attention the way Tupac did and still does.""[262] More simply, his writings, published after his death, inspired rapper YG to return to school and get his GED.[250] In 2020, former California Senator and current Vice-president Kamala Harris called Shakur the ""best rapper alive"", which she explained because ""West Coast girls think 2Pac lives on"".[263][264] According to writer Kevin Powell:""He deserves to be put in the same category as Bob Dylan, Bob Marley, as John Lennon, in terms of his global impact.""[265] Tupac is regarded as one of the most influential artists in music and popular culture in general and an icon of activism.[266]",tupac.txt,True
