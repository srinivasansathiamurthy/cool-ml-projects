# cool-ml-projects

Has cool stuff, and stuff needed to build more cool stuff. When you add projects, please add a short high level description of what it does here:

1. DMOCOPS: pretty modular script that allows you to run llm/etc operations on data on scale. Connected to lambda labs & s3: the scale comes from distributing the tasks across however many gpus you wish, and there's proper batch management if some gpus fail/etc. Easy to refactor for various batch management strategies.
2. DMTCS: google vision document text extraction model connected to gpt4o-mini. Scrappy DONUT w/ decision making abilities? Something like that.
3. ARAGOG: web crawler with SENTIENCE
