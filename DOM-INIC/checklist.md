just a checklist of stuff to do:

- [ ] Each node is just a simple representation of type, goal is to make it dynamic which plotly gives enough flexibility to do - on hover it would display information regarding the stored node
- [ ] Re-arrange the graph viz so it has a more defined structure, this would be hard though with dense graphs, but maybe try color coding and working on the size
- [ ] Need to bucket into more general groups, this will need a JSON, pickled data structure or anything where we can define relationships betwen tags (< p >, < h1 >) and their general category (text)
